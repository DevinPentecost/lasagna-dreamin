# Concept
The cat dreams of a lasagna.
Make it by pressing the correct buttons (QWER).
Cook it by pressing the correct buttons Shift+(QWE)
Throw it away by pressing Shift+R

If you make an incorrect lasagna, toss it.
Otherwise, put it together, cook it, and don't let it burn.
Feed the cat by using a cooked oven.

If you don't feed the cat enough he hates Tuesdays.

TODO:
1. Track what lasagna is currently made
1. Ovening/Trashing removes current stack
1. Cat dreams of random foods
1. You can cook a lasagna
1. Pulling it out of the oven too early or too late trashes it
1. Pulling out a lasagna that is not wanted trashes it
1. Pulling it out at the right time feeds the cat
1. Tracker on the dreams to show which are still 'valid' for the current stack
1. Score
1. Death
1. Polish
